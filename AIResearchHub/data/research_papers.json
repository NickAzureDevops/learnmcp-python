    "notes": "Comprehensive research completed on few-shot learning. Found key papers covering state-of-the-art methods, environmental robustness, multilingual approaches, and simple pipeline improvements. Identified practical implementations including comprehensive libraries (LibFewShot, FSL-Mate), ready-to-use frameworks (SetFit by HuggingFace), and tutorial-focused repositories (easy-few-shot-learning). The research spans both theoretical advances and practical implementation resources."
