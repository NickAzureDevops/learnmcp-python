# Let's Learn MCP with Python - Tutorial Series

A comprehensive guide to understanding and building Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers for Python developers through interactive learning experiences.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial series, you'll have:

1. **🐍 Python Study Buddy App** - An interactive console application that uses a custom MCP server to help developers learn Python concepts at beginner, intermediate, and expert levels
2. **🧠 AI Research Learning MCP Server** - Your own advanced MCP server that helps AI assistants find the latest AI/ML research papers, highlight top discoveries, and create personalized study plans

## Tutorial Structure

### [Part 1: Prerequisites and Setup](part1-setup.md)

**⏱️ Time: 15-20 minutes**

Set up your development environment and understand MCP fundamentals:
- Install VS Code, Python 3.12+, and Python extension
- Learn what Model Context Protocol is and why it matters
- Understand the client-server architecture
- Verify your development environment
